**PROJECT ASSIGNMENT #1**

**PROBLEM**

For the past few years, Yellevate has been struggling with client disputes. Yellevate defines disputes as clients expressing dissatisfaction with the company's services and refusing to pay for them. The team will be following Google's five phases of data analysis: ask, prepare, process, analyze and share.

Statistically, approximately 20% of the Yellevate conflicts resulted in a payment opt-out. This has resulted in a 5% annual revenue loss (in USD). Management has now asked the data analyst team to assist in resolving the problem. The team must identify the reasons of these issues using data gathered by the company and devise practical methods to resolve them.

Executives at the company decided that the following information should be obtained to identify the circumstances around the dispute problem:

1.  The processing time in which invoices are settled (average # of days rounded to a whole number).
2.  The processing time for the company to settle disputes (average # of days rounded to a whole number).
3.  Percentage of disputes received by the company that was lost (within two decimal places).
4.  Percentage of revenue lost from disputes (within two decimal places)
5.  The country where the company reached the highest losses from lost disputes (in USD).
